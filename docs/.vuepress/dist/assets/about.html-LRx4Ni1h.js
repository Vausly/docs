Sometimes I also share ​my real-life stories or experiences that I think ​are meaningful or difficult to forget.</p><p>I also like to play games. The games I play ​are Minecraft, Clash of Clans, Mobile Legends: ​Bang Bang, etc. My favorite games are open world.

There was a service called UTK.io, Created by an internet user named Chris on 30th September 2014. It was a service where ​you could share your Minecraft ​creations with the world, such as ​Maps, Mods, Seeds, Textures, etc. ​It was like a content creation ​platform. I started to upload my first content on 11th November 2017 and was well received by the community. One of my posts was featured by its developer in 2018. I abandoned that project ​in mid-2019 because I was too busy. ​Until the service was fully closed ​on 1st January 2023 by the original creator. But I see the site changed ownership to another person in September 2024. The content is still about Minecraft, but not in the format of a content creation platform.</p><h2 id="when-did-you-start-make-a​-video-content" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-did-you-start-make-a​-video-content"><span>When did you start make a​ video content?</span></a></h2><p>On 29th June 2017, I created a YouTube channel which is now called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabb5RfYa62j44O_uUPZI5A?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VausProject</a>.
