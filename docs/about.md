# About Vausly Media

## Intro
Hello, I am the admin of Vausly Media. Vausly ​is my digital identity. I really enjoy writing ​articles about anything I like such as the ​internet world, internet culture, computer ​technology, history, or anything related to that. ​I also write articles about tutorials and also ​information about games. Sometimes I also share ​my real-life stories or experiences that I think ​are meaningful or difficult to forget.

 I also like to play games. The games I play ​are Minecraft, Clash of Clans, Mobile Legends: ​Bang Bang, etc. My favorite games are open world. That's why Minecraft is the game I like ​the most from all the games I play.

## My Projects
I a lot of projects on the internet, including [Vausly Post](https://www.vausly.com), where I write articles about games, the internet, tutorials, and so on. I also have a channel on YouTube where I make videos. Actually there are so many projects that I do I can't explain.

## When did I start creating digital content?
I created my first digital content in 2017. There was a service called UTK.io, Created by an internet user named Chris on 30th September 2014. It was a service where ​you could share your Minecraft ​creations with the world, such as ​Maps, Mods, Seeds, Textures, etc. ​It was like a content creation ​platform. I started to upload my first content on 11th November 2017 and was well received by the community. One of my posts was featured by its developer in 2018. I abandoned that project ​in mid-2019 because I was too busy. ​Until the service was fully closed ​on 1st January 2023 by the original creator. But I see the site changed ownership to another person in September 2024. The content is still about Minecraft, but not in the format of a content creation platform.

## When did you start make a​ video content?
On 29th June 2017, I created a YouTube channel which is now called [VausProject](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCabb5RfYa62j44O_uUPZI5A?sub_confirmation=1). At first I made it just for fun. But I remembered about my friend who had made a video on YouTube in 2016. This inspired me to have the interest to make a video on YouTube. I got my first subscriber on 31st December 2017 just for commenting on someone's video on YouTube, entitled “[Fenomena Langit di Tahun 2018 Menurut Kalender Astronomi 2018](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzMobjXr4Q)”. And my first subscriber was [Mr. R (also known as Mr Ridwan)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtcUaJ7-V23zJ4rckk1xpMA?sub_confirmation=1).

The year after that, on 11th October 2018, I created a new channel which is now my main channel, now called [Vausly](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC8XmP-H3_bUKavcudu_M9g?sub_confirmation=1). I first started creating video ​content on 31st December 2018 on ​YouTube on that channel.
